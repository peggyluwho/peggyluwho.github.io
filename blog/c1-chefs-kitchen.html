    I'm just starting this new experience, Dev Bootcamp. I have spent the last week studying in a way that I have not done in almost twenty years.  I am in awe of what I have done in the last week, but I'm also intimidated by the pace set. I think it's completely reasonable to be asking myself "is this good for me?"

    Watching the Fireside video, I had feelings on both sides, where I felt that I was comforted by some of the concepts of the culture, and there were things that were sort of off-putting to me.   For example, when Shereef talked about fears and imposter syndrome.  I have experienced imposter syndrome many times in my life, and it was comforting to have that directly addressed.  Most people don't even know what imposter syndrome is, though most people have experienced it.  It's good to know that not only will I be battle the same fears as others, but also that it's expected behavior.

    The part that makes me nervous is the idea of driving my own education.  Up until this point in the process, I've been doing this on my own, part time, while still able to keep my job and some of my life.  It's not so much that I feel that, because I'm approaching this experience as a consumer, but because I am weary of giving up so much to be a guinnea pig.  That wasn't very comforting.  It makes me wonder if maybe there's another way to do this.

    On the other hand, I think that I can really get behind driving my own experience with some direction.  It's better than just being force fed like a fois gras goose. I don't want to be dictated to.

    I'm not 100% sure whether I fit with the culture of DBC, but I'm still all-in.  I am okay with not knowing right now.
