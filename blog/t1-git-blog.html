  <h1>Version Control</h1>
  <h2>Anybody can git this</h2>

    You're probably wondering what version control is and why you should care. While no one can make you care, there are some reasons why you might want to. Version control is a way to set milestones in your code. Imagine you were running a marathon, and in mile 15 you had a mishap. Let's say you had to stop to use the restroom. That might really mess up your overall pace, and keep you off the winners' podium. What if you could easily take yourself back to the fourteenth mile marker and start again from there? That is what version control can do. It can make it possible to go back to a previous marker in your code, and start over from there.

    Git is a version control tool that makes it easy to do version control from your computer's command line. It uses simple commands to check status, add, commit, and push changes to your code. A commit is like the mile marker in the analogy I used above of a runner in a marathon. Each is a moment in the timeline of your code that you can travel back to, and git is your flux capacitor; it's the thing which makes your code time travel possible.

    GitHub is a website where you can store projects that use git for version control. It is set up to easily store, fork, and branch your code, and since it is online, more than one person will be able to work on the code at the same time. It also allows other developers the ability to see what you're working on, if it's open source, and maybe suggest upgrades or fix bugs. Finally, it can also be a good way to show off your skills to other developers and potential employers.

    Git and GitHub are great tools for working on a project, keeping organized, and sharing work.
